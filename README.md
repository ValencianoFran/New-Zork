The Curse of the lost will be set in sea and islands. 
The protagonist is The Lost and we do not know his history. 
Our main objective will be leave the area of islands, but there is a problem, the sea is full of sharks 
and we have no way of killing them, so we must explore the map to find a way to eliminate them.

We can get pearls to trade with the shopman and buy the harpoon to kill the sharks and there are dialogues 
with the Explorer on the house.

You have an special attack, a split which deals 1 damage. (special attack <npc>)
