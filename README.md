The Curse of the lost will be set in sea and islands. 
The protagonist is shipwrecked and we do not know his history. 
Our main objective will be leave the area of islands, but there is a problem, the sea is full of sharks 
and we have no way of killing them, so we must explore the map to find a way to eliminate them.
